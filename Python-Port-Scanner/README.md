# Python Port Scanner
A very small port scanner, uses socket to scan one or multiple ip addresses to find open ports.

## How to use
Just run it on the terminal, it will tell you what to do

## Special note
I want to thank all those annonymous heroes that put code online, daily, as it was the internet who guided me to make this code and this short program a working one.
