# Python YOUTUBE downloader

This very small Python program uses the pytube library to ease the download of YouTube videos to my computer using the CLI, so I can stop using dodgy plugins.


## How to use

On your CLI, run the program

`python3 youtube-downloader.py`

This will request a TY link, just paste it, and the video will be downloaded on the same directory in which the main.py lives.


## Installation
To make it work, you need to install [pytube](
https://pytube.io/en/latest/):

`pip install pytube`

And, of course, have Python3 installed.


## Special note
I want to thank all those annonymous heroes that put code online, daily, as it was the internet who guided me to make this code and this short program a working one.
